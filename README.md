## How to Use
1. Open each project’s folder (links above).  
2. Start with the **README** inside the project, then open the Excel:
   - All calcs are formula-driven and named-range based.
   - **Assumptions** tabs expose drivers (growth, margins, cost of capital, working capital, capex, stress knobs).
   - Dashboards summarize outputs (FCF/DCF per share, coverage/leverage, KPI snapshots).
3. Memos and decks provide the **story**: rationale, drivers, actions, risks, and monitoring.

## Data & Assumptions
- Public figures are taken from recent company filings/IR materials and market quotes.  
- Where granular data isn’t available, **clearly labeled proxies** or **consensus-style assumptions** are used.  
- Changing inputs on the **Assumptions** sheet will cascade through all models.
