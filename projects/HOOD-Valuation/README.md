# Robinhood (HOOD) — Equity Valuation: DCF & Comps

**Deliverables**
- `HOOD_DCF_Comps_WITH_FORMULAS.xlsx` (3-statement + DCF with WACC×g sensitivity; comps table)
- `HOOD_Initiation_Memo.docx` (1-page thesis, catalysts, risks)
- `HOOD_Valuation_Deck.pptx` (5-slide walkthrough)

**What’s modeled**
- 5-year driver-based forecast (revenue growth, EBITDA margin, D&A, capex, ΔNWC)
- FCFF DCF with terminal value (Gordon), WACC from CAPM inputs
- Comps triangulation (peer median P/E × HOOD EPS; EV/EBITDA reference where sensible)

**Notes**
- Inputs reflect recent public data; where unavailable, widely accepted assumptions are labeled in the Excel.
- All math is in-cell formulas. Adjust drivers on the **Assumptions** tab to refresh.
